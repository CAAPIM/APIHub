# Healthcare App

The Healthcare app demonstrates a customization of [the Layer7 API Hub Library](../layer7-apihub/README.md). This app uses [the Layer7 API Hub mock server](../layer7-apihub-mock) as the backend server.

The Healthcare app is built on top of [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Available User Roles

The following user roles are available in this app:

- Portal Admin
  - login: `portalAdmin`
  - password: `Password@1`

- API Owner
  - login: `apiOwner`
  - password: `Password@1`
  
  - Org Publisher
  - login: `orgPublisher`
  - password: `Password@1`

- Org Admin
  - login: `Publisher`
  - password: `Password@1`

- Developer
  - login: `user`
  - password: `Password@1`

## Customize the Healthcare App

The Healthcare App leverages the customization mechanisms provided by its underlying libraries:
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/)
- [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Theming.html)
- [Layer7 API Hub](../layer7-apihub/README.md)

Each library builds on top of the previous.

### Theming

The theming process is comprised of customizing the design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) and customizing the components styles.

The custom [theme file](../src/theme.js) applies the changes. For the design tokens, you customize the color palette and the typography. For the components styles, you leverage the [global theme override mechanism](https://material-ui.com/customization/components/#global-theme-override).

The global theme references specific components by its style name (such as `MuiButton` for MaterialUI buttons) and override parts of its styles. You can override most of the components provided by the underlying libraries. The libraries use a convention for their style names:

- `Mui[ComponentName]` for MaterialUI components
- `Ra[ComponentName]` for react-admin components
- `Layer7[ComponentName]` for Layer7 API Hub components

### Default Components Replacements

The Healthcare app includes redesigned default API Hub pages. Customizing the theme has limited options. To implement a completely different layout, provide your own components. In the Healthcare app, a custom [Application Details View](./src/applications/CustomApplicationShow) is provided as an example.

The following authentication-related pages also differ in the Healthcare app from the default API Hub pages:

- [Login](./src/authentication/CustomLoginPage.js)
- [Reset Password](./src/authentication/CustomResetPasswordPage.js)
- [New Password](./src/authentication/CustomNewPasswordPage.js)
- [Sign Up](./src/authentication/CustomSignUpPage.js)
- [Account Setup](./src/authentication/CustomAccountSetupPage.js)

### Custom Pages

The Healthcare app implements a [landing page](./src/LandingPage/index.js) and a [dashboard](./src/homepage/HomePage.js) by leveraging react-admin's [custom routes mechanism](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Admin.html#customroutes). React-admin shows the [dashboard](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Admin.html#dashboard) by handling the root path. The landing page is displayed, which redirects authenticated users to the dashboard. This dashboard is added back as another custom route on the `/dashboard` path.
