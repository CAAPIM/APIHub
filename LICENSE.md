thereto including the defense of forum nonconveniens. In any action regarding this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any other relief, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses. If one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be unenforceable,
then such provision shall be considered inoperative to the extent of such enforceability and the
remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties hereto agree to
replace any such invalid or unenforceable provision with a new provision that has the most nearly
similar permissible economic or other effect.
